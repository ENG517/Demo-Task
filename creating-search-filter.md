    Common filter options include:

    - **Skip the Inbox**: message is archived
    - **Star it** message is marked as important
    - **Apply the label ------- **: message is given a label of your choosing
    - **Forward it**: message is sent to another address (e.g., home email)
    - **Never send to spam**: message arrives in inbox, avoiding spam filter
    - **Delete it**: message is deleted before arriving in the inbox

6.  Click Create filter.

**Note**: When you create a filter to forward messages, only new messages will be affected. Additionally, when someone replies to a message you've filtered, the reply will only be filtered if it meets the same search criteria.
